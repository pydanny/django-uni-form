   contain the root `toctree` directive.

django-uni-form
===============

Django_ forms are easily rendered as tables, paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to provide a tag and filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div format while providing an enormous amount of capability to configure and control the rendered HTML. 

It comes geared with a filter called ``|as_uni_form`` and a tag called ``{% uni_form %}``. 

You can use the filter to render your forms using elegantly div based fields::

    {% load uni_form_tags %}
    
    <form action="" method="POST" class="uniForm">
        {{ form|as_uni_form }} 
    </form>

And yet, django-uni-form does much more! By providing a form helper and sophisticated layout handling easily attachable to a form, you can control form rendering behavior and create a form layout in pure Python with a minimum of HTML, thus controling things like order of the fields, wrap them in divs or other structures, add html, set DOM ids or classes to whatever you want, adding inputs, etc. This is done via the :ref:`form helpers`. This way you can do stuff like::

    from uni_form.helper import FormHelper
    from uni_form.layout import Layout, Div, ButtonHolder, Submit
    
    class MyForm(forms.Form):   # or class MyForm(forms.ModelForm)
        form_field_1 = forms.CharField(...)

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.helper = FormHelper()
            self.helper.form_action = 'my-url-name-defined-in-url-conf'
            self.helper.form_method = 'GET'

            self.helper.layout = Layout(
                Div(
                    'form_field_4',
                    'form_field_1',
                ),
                Div(
                    'form_field_2',
                    'form_field_3',
                ),
                ButtonHolder(
                    Submit('save', 'Save', css_class='button white')
                )
            )
            return super(MyForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

You can render an instance of `MyForm` using this helper and layout adding this code to a template, you wont::
    
    {% load uni_form_tags %}
    {% uni_form my_form my_form.helper %}
            
.. note:: Obviously, the excellent `Uni-form`_ has been selected as the base model for the design of the forms.
