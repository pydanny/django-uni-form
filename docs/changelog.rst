0.8.0
=====

Built-in csrf support
----------------------

Fully generated forms from the `uni_form` tag now have Django 1.2+'s support for csrf built-in.

Field labels now with safe filter
----------------------------------

This release renders django.form.field labels with the 'safe_' filter. If you have user generated form field labels you should take this into consideration.

On the rare occasions this a problem, just create a **uni_form** directory in your templates directory, copy `uni_form/templates/uni_form/field.html` there, and remove the 'safe_' filter.

errorMsg div now outside the fieldset
-------------------------------------

This release lays out the HTML for the uni_form tag differently than previous versions. The errorMsg div is now outside the fieldset as it should be.

uni_form_tags has been split into two files
---------------------------------------------

Because `uni_form_tags` got so big it was broken up into two files, `uni_form_tags` and `uni_form_filters`. In order to support backwards compatibility, `uni_form_tags`
imports all the functions of `uni_form_filters`, so existing projects won't be affected.

Removed {% uni_form_jquery %} tag
---------------------------------

This was always somewhat problematic to get working. Static media should not be obfuscated via code and while this tag seemed helpful in practice it caused more headaches then what it was worth.

Elevated Miguel Araujo to project lead
--------------------------------------

This project has needed a much more active project lead for some time. Miguel Araujo shares my passion for good form generation and has a very deep understanding of python, django, and HTML. Also, his decisions on everything about this project either matches my own thoughts or he's been able to easily convince me why his concepts are sound.

Miscellaneous
--------------

* Elevated Miguel Araujo to project lead!

0.7.0
=====

Calling the template tags library
---------------------------------

Release 0.7 and higher breaks backwards compatibility with previous versions of django-uni-form . All you have to do is update templates that call on the django-uni-form template tag from::

    {% load uni_form %}

To::

    {% load uni_form_tags %}

.. _safe: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/builtins/#safe

Miscellaneous
---------------

* Removed a <hr /> from the layout module.
* Changed templatetags/uni_form.py to templatetags/uni_form_tags.py. Yes, this breaks backwards compatibility but fixes a namespace problems in Django with naming a templatetag library after the parent application.
* Changed form_action attribute to accept not just named URLs but also any old URL.
* Added in uni_form_setup tag.
* Added tests
* Added several new contributors including Dragan Babic
* Added Danish language translation
