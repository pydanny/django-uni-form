CHANGELOG
=========

For 0.8.0

 * Improved internal documentation
 * form methods generated by FormHelper are in lowercase (http://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form/issues#issue/20)
 * uni_form.helpers.formHelper or None object must be passed into uni_form tag or a TypeError is thrown.
 * Thanks to Nagy Viktor added form_tag attribute to FormHelper. Now you can use the uni_form tag without the leading and training form tags.
 * Thanks for Alison Rowland for giving django-uni-form sphinx docs
 * Incorporated uni-form 1.4 by Dragan Babic
 * Provide better adherence to uni-form specification of error messages
 * mirumee provided some great work for making FormHelper more subclassable.
 * django-uni-form 0.8 and higher lays out the HTML for the uni_form tag differently. The errorMsg div is now outside the fieldset as it should be.
 * Thanks to Casper S. Jensen django-uni-form now supports 1.2 style csrf_token.
 * csrf_token does not break earlier versions of Django. This will change when no version of django does not support csrf_token.
 * Thanks to j0hnsmith changed {{ error }} to {{ error|safe }} so that html (eg links) can be 
 added to error messages.
 * Thanks to j0hnsmith changed {{ field.label }} to {{ field.label|safe }} so that html (eg 
 links) can be added to field labels
 * Thanks to Stepan Rakhimov fixed an admin datetime issue.
 * Thanks to patrys (Patryk Zawadzki) FormHelper class is now easily subclass-able.
 * Added support for formsets by introducing the as_uni_form_set filter
 * Added contributors of the formsets feature

For 0.7.0

 * Removed a <hr /> from the layout module.
 * Changed templatetags/uni_form.py to templatetags/uni_form_tags.py. Yes, this breaks backwards compatibility but fixes a namespace problems in Django with naming a templatetag library after the parent application.
 * Changed form_action attribute to accept not just named URLs but also any old URL.
 * Added in uni_form_setup tag.
 * Added tests
 * Added several new contributors including Dragan Babic
 * Added Danish language translation
